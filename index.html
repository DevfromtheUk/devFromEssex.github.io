            Hi. I'm a student from Essex (hence the name) who has a wide knowledge of Front-end development skills. 
            I can create and redesign websites in full, web templates, shopify stores, email templates and more. 
            All my work costs nothing (though if your satisfied i won't say no to a small donation!) and goes onto
            my portfolio for when i finish my education. This site has some of my information, work and contact details
            if your interested or want to have a chat about any oppurtunities. Feel free to look around!<br><br>
            Every 15 seconds this text will change to a random piece of information!
